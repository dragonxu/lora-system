# What is LoRa & LoRaWAN

## LoRa

LoRa is the physical layer or the wireless modulation utilized to create the long range communication link. It's a spread spectrum modulation technique derived from chirp spread spectrum (CSS) technology. LoRa maintains the same low power characteristics as FSK modulation but significantly increases the communication range.

## LoRaWAN

The LoRaWAN open specification is a low power, wide area networking (LPWAN) protocol based on LoRa Technology. The specification, which is specified by LoRa Alliance, defines the communication protocol and system architecture for LoRa networks. The protocol and network architecture have the most influence in determining the battery lifetime of a node, the network capacity, the quality of service, the security, and the variety of applications served by the network.
